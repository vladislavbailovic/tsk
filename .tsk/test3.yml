    Implement `tsk` CRUD for tasks
    ================================

    Okay, so the first order of business is to implement a set of CRUD operations for the `tsk`.

    But before that, I need to decide on the format. Currently looking into YAML, which is what
    this thing is for.

    > It needs to preserve stuff such as linebreaks and indentations.
        >> E.g. this is an indented response

    ```
    // and a code example right here
    ```

    - How about
    - Some
    - Lists here?

    This ^ is a HR line separator.

    Yeah, this all needs to work
